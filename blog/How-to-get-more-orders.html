          <div class="col-12 headd " id="share-your-online">
            <p>If you’ve just started your online business, you probably have plenty of ideas about getting the word out and driving more traffic. 
                But what if you want to take your sales figures a notch higher? Well, many new online businesses struggle with the conversion of 
                traffic, especially in their early days. So here are some ideas 
                for boosting sales of your online store. Let’s dive right in and explore these tips in detail:</p>

              
              <!-- <p>Are you still thinking about taking your business online?</p> -->
              <h3 id="high-quality-img"> 1. Use high-quality images to showcase your products</h3>

              <p>When you upload your products to your online store, ensure to use high-quality images. 
                 In an online business, your pictures are equivalent to your in-store salespeople. Pictures matter, 
                 especially since, your customers view your products and decide if they want to read their descriptions or buy these in seconds.
                 So having high-quality images can enhance your chances of making a sale.</p>


                   <div class="container blogi">
           <div class="row bulb-row align-items-center">
            <div class="col-3 col-md-3">
                <img src="assets/images/bulb.png" class="bulb" alt="icon" >
              </div> 
      
              <div class="col-8 col-md-9 note">
             <p><strong class="bold">Pro-tip:</strong> Ensure that your images accurately represent your product. Accessories that are not a part
                     of the product should not be included. Product images set customer expectations and should display exactly what your
                     customer will receive. Use a white background to ensure your images are non-distracting.</p>

            </div>
             
              
          <h3 id="keep-shipping" >2. Keep shipping costs as minimal as possible (or free) </h3>
          <p>With online purchases being at an all-time high, many businesses and e-retailers offer free shipping as an 
            incentive to customers. So after piquing your customers' interest in purchasing your products, the next step
             would be to encourage them to add products to their cart. However, at this stage, if customers see additional 
             shipping charges being levied, they may choose to drop the purchase altogether. According to a Forbes report,
              more than 75% of online buyers would abandon their cart if shipping charges are added to their shopping list. If possible, 
            add minimum or zero shipping charges for online orders or be upfront about your shipping charges.</p> 


              <div class="container blogi">
           <div class="row bulb-row align-items-center">
            <div class="col-3 col-md-3">
                <img src="assets/images/bulb.png" class="bulb" alt="icon" >
              </div> 
      
              <div class="col-8 col-md-9 note">
            <p><strong class="bold">Pro-tip:</strong> You can consider setting up free-shipping promotions above a certain purchase value threshold 
                (for instance, free shipping on orders above INR X99). This can encourage customers to build their baskets and potentially induce 
                trials for a higher number of products
                 to avail themselves of the free shipping offer. To know how to set this up on SmartBiz by Amazon,

            </div>
          </div><br>

             

        <h3 id="target-suggestion">3. Provide targeted suggestions to your customers </h3>
        <p>Providing suggestions to your customers can heighten the probability of them buying from you. You can list your 
            most frequently purchased products under a 
            section ‘you might also like’ or ‘other customers have also viewed’ as suggestions. </p>

        <p>In addition, providing suggestions can give your customers a better idea of what your products do. Diwali is coming up? 
            Provide suggestions for relevant products, maybe sweets, accessories, 
            gifting, and clothing items. This helps make the customer purchase decision and journey easier.</p>

        <h3 id="request-customer">4. Request customer feedback and include social proof on your website</h3>
        <p>Ensure to ask your customers for feedback once they complete purchasing your products. This will help you to understand if 
            your customers are satisfied with your products and help you identify areas for improvement. Customer feedback can also 
            help you explore new opportunities you had not considered before. What's more,  new customers always read reviews online
             before making purchases. So having lots of positive feedback, real customer testimonials, and pictures and videos of customers using your product can offer social proof and help your online store build credibility, ultimately increasing your sales.</p>

          
        <h3 id="create-packages">5. Create packages and deals to induce trials</h3>
        <p>Who doesn’t love a good bargain. People love to buy things that they get on a good deal. You can keep a track 
            of which products are being frequently purchased together. With this information, you can combine similar products 
            into one package and offer a sale/discount as an incentive for buying the combo. You can also curate packages and gifts 
            for special occasions and offer slashed prices during key shopping seasons. </p>

              <div class="container blogi">
           <div class="row bulb-row align-items-center">
            <div class="col-3 col-md-3">
                <img src="assets/images/bulb.png" class="bulb" alt="icon" >
              </div> 
      
              <div class="col-8 col-md-9 note">
             <p><strong class="bold">Pro-tip:</strong> You can also consider introducing new products on your website at special prices for a limited period
             or for a limited number of customer purchases (For instance, available at a flat 50% off for the first 50 customers). You can use social media to build anticipation about upcoming offers and create excitement and urgency when the offer is live.</p>

              </div>
            </div>
          </div><br>

        

        <h3 id="great-customer-service">6. Offer great customer service</h3>
        <p>Great customer service is always valued because it makes customers believe in your efforts. 
            Adding your contact details by including your phone number, email address, and social media links helps users get in touch with you easily. Offering easy and hassle-free returns or exchanges also helps build confidence in your customers.</p>

        <p>The most crucial thing is to reply right away when customers contact you, as it will strengthen your relationship.</p>

            <h3 id="purchase-journey">7. Simplify the customer purchase journey</h3>
            <p>You need to ensure that the customer purchase journey you are presenting on your online store is as simple, 
                easy to comprehend, and reassuring as possible. Customers should be able to find exactly what they are 
                looking for in the minimum possible steps. Not only this, they should be able to make the purchase without a lot of friction. 
                Decluttering the check-out process and adding visible trust markers to reassure customers about your website’s authenticity is also essential.  You can conduct usability studies to understand how customers are perceiving/using your online store.A simple way to do this is to just watch your friends and family go through the process of discovering and buying your products.
                Look for areas where they are struggling and improve their experience.</p>

            <h3 id="instant-messaging">8. Use instant messaging as a channel of communication</h3>
            <p>A lot of businesses are using instant messaging platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, and Snapchat to 
                communicate with their audience, and you can be one of them too. You can also send personalized
                  messages to provide tailored experiences to your customers. You can also increase your
                 credibility by sharing regular updates with your customers regarding their purchases/orders.</p>

            <h3 id="power-of-social">9. Harness the power of social</h3>
            <p>You need to be where your target audience spends most of their time these days - on social media. 
                According to the World Economic Forum, global internet users spend an average of 2 hours and 27 minutes per
                 day on social media. New brands are increasingly being discovered on social media by customers. You can 
                 engage your audience in interesting conversations using posts, reels, stories, quizzes, polls, and more. 
                 Encourage them to share their purchases and reviews on social media with their own audiences. Leverage social
                  influencers to talk about your product and increase your brand’s reach within their niche and relevant audience.
                   Promote your online sale events and discounts on social media. By creating an engaging social  
                experience, you can increase your brand awareness and convert your social followers into customers.</p>

            <h3 id="subscriber-list">10. Build up your email subscriber list</h3>
            <p>You can create an email newsletter and use the same to keep your customers updated with sale events, product usage tips, customer testimonials and successes, and new launches.</p>
